# Images Directory

This directory contains images used in the README.md file.

## Required Images

To complete the README, add the following images:

1. **banner.png** - Header/banner image for the extension (recommended size: 1200x300px)
   - Should include the extension name and logo
   - Professional, clean design

2. **workflow.png** - Diagram showing the extension workflow
   - Visual representation of: Code Analysis → RAG Retrieval → AI Classification → Contract Generation → Dashboard
   - Can be created with tools like draw.io, Mermaid, or Figma

3. **dashboard.png** - Screenshot of the extension dashboard
   - Shows the interactive UI with violation detection and contract generation
   - Take a screenshot while the dashboard is open in VS Code

4. **example-before.png** - Screenshot of code before contract application
   - Shows Python code with ML API violations highlighted
   - VS Code editor screenshot with code visible

5. **example-after.png** - Screenshot of code after contract application
   - Shows the same code with generated PyContracts applied
   - Demonstrates the fix with @contract decorators

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: PNG or JPG
- **Size**: Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB per image)
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Banner: 1200x300px
  - Screenshots: 800-1200px width
  - Diagrams: 800-1000px width
- **Optimization**: Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images
- **Accessibility**: Ensure images have descriptive alt text in README.md

## Creating Images

### Screenshots
1. Open VS Code with the extension running
2. Use a screenshot tool (Windows: Snipping Tool, Mac: Cmd+Shift+4)
3. Capture the relevant UI elements
4. Save as PNG in this directory

### Diagrams
1. Use draw.io, Mermaid, or Figma
2. Export as PNG
3. Ensure text is readable at smaller sizes
4. Use consistent colors and styling
